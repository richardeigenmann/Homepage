		<p>Sandra applied for a Job in Cape Town. They took her application seriously and invited her to Cape Town for a
			full day of assessment and another day of interviews. She wasn't prepared for the phone call she got on
			Friday afternoon while she was relaxing next to the pool of Jay and Nicole's loft apartment. It was her
			future boss who asked her back to discuss modalities!</p>

		<p>She is to become the Program Manager for the PIP in South Africa. This is a post which is paid for by the EU
			(in Rands alas) and is hosted out of PPECB. I have trouble with all these acronyms but PIP means Pesticide
			Initiative Program and PPECB is the Perishable Products Export Control Board. They are responsible for the
			quality of fresh produce leaving South Africa and are a semi governmental organisation. Sandra's role - as I
			understand it - involves reviewing and approving projects to get certain chemicals accredited for use on
			fruits. I hope the chemical companies give her massive bribes so she can shower me with expensive gifts! :-)
		</p>

		<p>As the job is hosted in Cape Town she needs to move there. She spent the rest of the interview weekend
			looking at places. I flew out the next weekend and helped her review more options. Jay was extremely helpful
			putting us up in his loft (which he is busy trying to sell) and investigating properties for us as well as
			his chauffeur services. Thanks also go to Suraj and Tanja as well as Henry.</p>

		<p>One of the first properties Sandra saw took her fancy. She wasn't really thinking of buying a house so she
			didn't put in an offer right away. Unfortunately an old hag did. She is so old that the bank had to review
			the property before they offered her the loan. Sadly they granted her the loan and Sandra goes empty handed.
			The old woman bought the place as an investment but has no money to do renovations. She would rent it out to
			Sandra at a greedy price and probably expect Sandra to touch it up at her own cost. It just doesn't work
			like that!</p>

		<p>Instead we are now going to stay in a new complex called "Century on Lake". These are brand new Townhouses
			just behind the Canal Walk shopping Centre. They are very easy to find: Take the N1 towards Paarl and when
			you see the Canal Walk shopping centre take the exit before the complex (Sable Road) and just after the bend
			you find it. The place Sandra chose is in the second floor. It's not extremely huge by South African
			standards but it does have a separate en-suite shower and toilet off the master bedroom. There is a nice
			sized terrace with evening sun, a view on Table Mountain and a bird sanctuary out front. I hope the birds
			will stick to their sanctuary because if they come and poop over our terrace they will meet with a little
			opposition!</p>

		<p>The place is in a secure complex. It also has a swimming pool and braii area. There is also some sort of
			laundry facility.</p>

		<p style="clear: both;">Our tour took us past the Cleopatra Farmhouse in the Drakensberg mountains. <a
				href="http://www.cleomountain.com">http://www.cleomountain.com</a> Richard and Mouse Poynton run an
			exclusive restaurant there and we were lucky enough to have won 2 nights there with the Green Rhino travel
			agency. We feasted on the supreme cooking!</p>
