		<p>I returned to Cape Town with an old school day friend of mine, Reini. He was in dire need of some vacation
			and decided to visit me and Sandra in South Africa. We went straight to Cape Town and explored that
			thoroughly. This included the Wine Route, the Waterfront, Signal Hill, Table Mountain, Robben Island, Cape
			Point and a scenic flight in a helicopter. We then flew up to Johannesburg where we spent a day at Gold Reef
			City. Then Sandra had her graduation ceremony from Pretoria University for which she had to dress up in an
			academic robe. Aferwards we put Sandra on a plane to Cape Town to earn some money whilst we headed out east
			to see wildlife in Kr&uuml;ger and Tshukudu. I was very impressed with Olifants camp in Kr&uuml;ger but
			Tshukudu - that I have such nice memories of - was a disappointment. They haven't got a Lion at the right
			age to take on walks in the morning. The cheetah Savanna was in hiding and the Leopard cage wasn't for
			entering this time either. We did see the two wild male elephants they added to the park for lonely Becky.
			This was the first time in two weeks that they had been spotted so everyone was rather excited.</p>

		<p>Whilst looking at an elephant just outside Satara camp in Kr&uuml;ger Park my cell phone rang. On the other
			end of the line was a manager from my former employer. He enquired about my interest in returning to the
			working and offered me a six month assignment doing what I had been doing before, namely managing projects,
			resolving issues but also helping out where the need might arise. I accepted the offer.</p>

		<p>My last two weeks in South Africa were spent improving my JPO application. Sandra was invited to give a
			speech at the Project Managers of South Africa conference in the Gallagher Estate, just outside
			Johannesburg. We flew up early and were able to attend a few presentations before she gave hers.</p>

		<p>I've been back in Switzerland now for two weeks and am gradually adjusting back to spending a nice summer
			working in an office!</p>
