			<em>Lion attacking Richard's leg</em></p>

		<p>OK I admit it. I'm exaggerating rather badly here. But it did get you attention, right? We went to Tshukudu
			Game Reserve. They run a Lion breeding project. Their Lions are all Tuberculosis free. Lots of Lions in
			Kruger Park have TB so this seems like a good idea. They also breed Cheetahs and Leopards. If you get there
			before 16:00 they take you on a game drive around the bush and you visit their Lions and Leopards. You get
			very close to the Lions as you drive right into their enclosures. In the mornings you are taken on a Game
			Walk with a real lion. The lion is tame which doesn't necessarily mean it's not powerful or has a reduced
			set of teeth. We walked with a nine month old female who was full of play. At one point in the walk you are
			allowed to pose behind the lion to have your picture taken. When I stood behind her she figured she would
			have a little play with my leg. She wrapped her powerful front paws aground it and gently (for a lion)
			placed her teeth around my lower leg. The rangers intervened immediately and the big binoculars I had on my
			shoulder fell down as I bent down. They fell straight on the lions face which clearly gave her the message
			that chewing tourist's legs is not really the right way to behave!</p>

		<p>Here are some of the other pictures we took at the Reserve:</p>

		<p>I was having a nice evening braii (barbecue) with Sandra on the evening of the 12th of January in the Swadini
			Adventura Resort in the Lowveld when Sandra suddenly noticed a tiny snake on his way home to a crack in the
			bricks of our cottage. His path took him straight under her chair and she might have stepped on him had she
			not seen him. He wasn't very bothered by our presence and made to his hole. Shortly afterwards he emerged
			again from a different crack (or was this a different snake? It seemed a little thinner). He then crawled
			along the wall and explored a few bricks before hiding in a different crack. He was perhaps 30cm long and
			very thin. Perhaps 4 or 5 mm. I'm glad to be back in Johannesburg now. I've been a little to close to nature
			for comfort recently!</p>

			<em>Atractaspis bibronii - Burrowing Adder </em></p>

		<p>After showing this picture to the guy doing the snake show at the Lion and Rhino Park just outside
			Johannesburg we now believe this is a Burrowing Adder. They grow to about 2 feet and dig a lot. They have
			special posion teeth that allow then to strike sideways. They are poisonous and tend to come out at night or
			during rain.</p>
