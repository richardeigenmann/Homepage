      <h2>
            Laborie Vineyard Restaurant in Paarl
      </h2>
      <p>
            Right above Paarl lie the vineyards of Laborie. They do the regular wine tasting there but I am not too keen
            on the wine. They have an excellent sweet wine though, the Pineau de Laborie which is reasonably priced and
            can also be bought in a nice gift arrangement with 2 glasses. The highlight, however, is the restaurant.
            Situated underneath magnificent trees you can enjoy a delicious meal with a view over Paarl form their
            terrace. I've been there several times and can vouch for the Chicken Maroccan salad. I believe the other
            dishes are also good.</p>

      <h2>Moyo Restaurant</h2>
      <p>
            All good restaurants spawn chains in South Africa. Moyo is no exception. There's one in Melrose Arch in
            Johannesburg as well as in the Market Theatre. There's also a huge one in Spier, within driving distance of
            Cape Town. This one is huge with tents and stuff. You get an African experience. Artists come round and
            paint your face. You choose ethinc African dishes and if they fear you might be letting yourself in for
            something you might not like they will fetch you a sample from the kitchen. The food is delicious. There's a
            stage and usually some chap with a giutar. A great place to go for a meal! A <A
                  href="http://simonandbaker.com/moyo.html">review</A> of the Johannesburg Moyo. <A

      <h2>Rhino &#038; Lion park, north of Johannesburg</h2>
      <p>
            If you can't get to Kr&uuml;ger Park stop off in the Rhino & Lion park. Best is a Sunday because the lions
            are fed then. They also have tigers in the park. I was able to play with a 7 weeks old tiger cub there!
            Their <A href="http://www.rhinolion.co.za/rhino.html">website</A>, my <A href="sa7.htm">visit</A></p>

      <h2>Montecasino - A casino done like an italian village</h2>
      <p>
            Fascinating architecture; it looks just like the postcards of italy. Only that the dilapidation is painted
            on the walls rather than real. Also the dirt and noise of real Italy is absent. Amazing. Located in the
            North of Johannesburg. Don't take picutres in the casino unless you feel like explaining to security all
            about your photographic assignments! <A href="http://www.montecasino.co.za">Website</A></p>

      <h2>Market Theatre</h2>
      <p>Located in the South of Johannesburg I've watched some good plays there. <A
                  href="http://www.markettheatre.co.za/">Website</A></p>


      <h2>Chez Vincent, Bed and Breakfast, Nelspruit</h2>
      <p>An excellent place to stay for a night. French originating Vincent runs a spotless place with his wife in
            Nelspruit just outside the Kr&uuml;ger Park. His Breakfast is divine! <A
                  href="http://www.chezvincent.co.za/">website</A></p>


      <h2>Tsitsikamma Treetop Gliding</h2>
      <p>
            Located far East of Cape Town (perhaps 800km?) is the Storm River Mouth. Enterprising South Africans have
            copied the idea seen in Costa Rica and now offer a treetop gliding tour. Excellent fun if on the expensive
            side. You are hooked in a harness and slide along steel ropes from tree to tree. Nothing for people who fear
            hights. <A href="http://www.tsitsikammacanopytour.co.za/">Website</A></p>

      <h2>Avlon Springs, Montagu, Western Cape</h2>
      <p>
            A warm water spring, Avlon Springs in Montagu can be reached from Cape Town in a day trip albeit a long one.
            They accept day visitors to their pools but will tell you to get out out the residents only pool if you
            stray there. <A href="http://www.avalonsprings.co.za/">website</A>. I noted from Sonja and Eugen's trip that
            this could be combined with a visit to Rietfontein Farm.</p>


      <h2>Caledon Spa</h2>
      <p>Out behind Cape Town behind the toll tunnel somewhere is Caledon Spa. It's on my list of places to see. <a
                  href="https://www.tsogosun.com/the-caledon-casino/spa">https://www.tsogosun.com/the-caledon-casino/spa</a>
      </p>

      <h2>Bela-Bela (renamed from Warmbaths) Forever (Aventura) Resort</h2>
      <p>This hot spring is 100km north of Pretoria. They have large outdoor pools. <a
                  href="http://www.foreverwarmbaths.co.za/">http://www.foreverwarmbaths.co.za/</a></p>

      <h2>Forever Resorts Swadini</h2>
      <p>Fantastic place to stay in the Limpopo province. Loads of well equipped chalets and cool scenery. <A
                  href="http://www.foreverswadini.co.za/">http://www.foreverswadini.co.za/</a></p>


      <h2>
            Kite Surfing in Blouberg
      </h2>
      <p>Contact <A href="http://www.cabrinha.co.za/">Cabrinha</A> to book classes. Call ahead of time and be flexible
            as more often than not the wind is not quite right.</p>

      <h2>Boulder Bay Penguins</h2>
      <p>From Cape Town take an excursion to Simon's Town and have a look at the Penguins on Boulder Bay. Try to combine
            this with a drive over Chapman’s Peak drive (toll road) which is spectacular. <A
                  href="http://www.simonstown.com/tourism/penguins/penguins.htm">http://www.simonstown.com/tourism/penguins/penguins.htm</A>
      </p>


      <h2>Blue Peter</h2>
      <p>Head up along the Bloubergstrand to the Blue Peter Hotel. A sensational location for sitting on the steps or
            the lawn, having a pint and enjoying the blue sky and the view over Cape Town and Table Mountain. The
            Pizza's are not as bad as Sandra makes them out to be any more. <A
                  href="http://bbs.keyhole.com/ubb/showthreaded.php/Cat/0/Number/75414/an/0/page/5">link</A></p>


      <h2>On The Rocks</h2>
      <p>When you get hungry in Blouberg head for the On The Rocks restaurant. Pricy but excellent with fantastic views
            on Cape Town. <A href="hhttp://www.ontherocks.co.za/">http://www.ontherocks.co.za/</A></p>


      <h2>Gordons Bay - Whale Watching</h2>
      <p>I've never done it but apparently in Season around Gordon's Bay there is Whale Watching to be done: <A
                  href="http://cybercapetown.com/WhaleWatching/whalewatching.shtml">website</A></p>

      <h2>Maestros</h2>
      <p>I know of two Maestros restaurants in Cape Town. One is in Town on one of those long streets that go up the
            hill. The food was good but pricey. When I was there with Jay we saw some rhodent scurry across the floor.
            Perhaps it's hard to keep vermin out of old houses but if you don't the next thing will be the Cobras coming
            after them and those are customers you perfer not to have. The second restaurant is on the newly built up
            lagoon in front of Milnerton. It has a fantastic view over the ocean but for an evening meal it's not ideal
            as the panoramic windows will just open up on a black ocean with the odd spec of a freighter in it.</p>




      <h2>Sinns Restaurant</h2>
      <p>A stylish affair integreated into the tiny Wembley Square mall. <A href="http://www.sinns.co.za/"></A></p>

      <h2>La Med </h2>
      <p>An excellent place for sundowners at the foot of lions head in Clifton. Can be windy. Supposedly called the
            Bungalow now. <A href="https://www.thebungalow.co.za/">Website</A></p>

      <h2>Sushi in CTFM</h2>
      <p>A godsend for those that love Sushi: Cape Town Fish Market. The name is silly as it a restaurant chain that
            does mainly fish. There's an excellent one in Canal Walk shopping center that has discounts on Mondays. But
            they are all over too. They also sell fish so there might be something in the name.<A
                  href="http://www.ctfm.co.za/">website</A></p>

      <h2>Sushi in Blowflish Restaurant on Dolphin Beach Hotel</h2>
      <p>A nice scenec venue on the beginning of Bloubergstrand. When we were there they didn't remember the advertised
            specials.</p>

      <h2>Driving range in Century City</h2>
      <p>If you are found without a car around Century City, check out the golf driving range between the shopping
            centre and the motorway.</p>

      <H2>Platteklip Gorge</H2>
      <P>If you are fit you can go up Table Mountain in less then an hour. It's tough. And sometimes people get mugged.
      </P>

      <h2>Lions Head</h2>
      <p>If you are tired of Table Mountain or it's to tough try Lions Head. The trail winds around the rock and you
            have to navigate a steep bit with the help of a metal chain.</p>

      <h2>Signal Hill</h2>
      <p>Take your coolerbox up to the car park on Signal Hill for sundowners.</p>


      <h2>Kirstenbosch Gardens</h2>
      <p>If you are into plants I'm sure it's great. I really enjoyed the concert they did there. In Summer most
            evenings there will be a concert. You bring your blanket, coolerbox and enjoy the evening. <A
                  href="https://www.sanbi.org/gardens/kirstenbosch/">website.</A></p>

      <h2>West Coast Park - Langebaan</h2>
      <p>The water in Cape Town is too cold for swimming. But if you drive 100km along the North Coast you get to the
            West Coast Park and the bay of Langebaan. Since there is no revolting river emptying itself into the ocean
            the water is quite clear. Due to the shallowness of the water it heats up quickly and is pleasant for
            swimming. On the other side of the lagoon I believe you can take kyte surfing lessons too.</p>

      <h2>Sun City</h2>
      <p>The casino isn't much but the setting of the two hotels and the Pilanisberg Nature Reserve in the Crater of an
            extinct volcano is quite special.</p>

      <h2>Gold Reef City</h2>
      <p>A huge theme park with a special attraction: a real gold mine. It's only 300m deep and nicely done up for
            tourists. Next to it is the Apartheid Museum which is well done and is interesting from it's architectural
            design too. <A href="http://www.goldreefcity.co.za/home/index.asp" name="website"></A></p>

      <h2>Rustica Restorant</h2>
      <p>On a nice warm evening visitg the La Rustica Restaurant for a meal in Johannesburg. It's nice open architecture
            opens up on the gardens.</p>

      <h2>Aubergine</h2>
      <p>The Aubergine is a high class restaurant well tucked away in Cape Town. The portions are a bit minimalist so it
            you feel like that 500g T-Bone you're better off in Spur but the food is very nice. A Restaurant for special
            occasions. <A href="http://www.aubergine.co.za/">website</A></p>

      <h2>Cape Town Waterfront Aquarium</h2>
      <p>I've never been but it might be worth a visit on a rainy day. <A href="http://www.aquarium.co.za/">website</A>
      </p>

      <h2>3 day Wine Walk around Wellington</h2>
      <p>The Platter wine book mentions a 3 day Wine Walk around Wellington which sounds interesting. <A
                  href="http://www.winescapetours.co.za/">website</A></p>

      <h2>Pieter-Dirk Uys theatre in Darling</h2>
      <p>I've seen his Anti Aids satire on television and Sandra has been to his Theatre in Darling. Apparently it is
            very good. He also goes by the name of Evita se Perron. <A href="http://evita.co.za/">website</A></p>


      <h2>Transport from Cape Town Airport to the City</h2>
      <p>There is no bus service from the airport. You can catch a taxi or pre-arrange a shuttle. The cost is about R150
            to the city (20 kms). The Backpacker Bus (www.backpackerbus.co.za) offers the cheapest door-to-door airport
            transfer, starting at R90.</p>

      <h2>The Cape Town Explorer bus</h2>
      <p>Jump-on-jump-off double-decker bus that cover the major attractions in the city, great way to get a quick
            orientation of Cape Town and close vicinities. It also stops at the Table Mountain cable car and Camps Bay.
            You can buy tickets at the Tourist Info centres.</p>


      <h2>Beaches</h2>
      <h3>Camps Bay</h3>
      <p>very wide beach. Very popular and gets crowded when the weather is sunny and warm. Showers and toilets
            available, deck chairs and brollies for hire, roaming drinks and ice cream sellers. Great for suntanning,
            beach volleyball and people-watching.</p>

      <h3>Clifton 4</h3>
      <p>smaller beach surrounded by boulders and housing. Very popular, services as above.</p>

      <h3>Llandudno,</h3>
      <p>A favourite. Secluded and small, but can get busy at sundown. Beautiful setting but no facilities.</p>

      <h3>Muizenberg</h3>
      <p>If you are not brave enough for the Atlantic waters above and wish to go for a dip, head to the Indian Ocean
            side. A popular beach there is Muizenberg, it is very wide and also good for surfing. Can get crowded on
            week-ends.</p>

      <h3>Madame Zingara, 192 Loop St, Tel: 021 426-2458</h3>
      <p>Famous for their steak with chocolate sauce and decadent bohemian decor. They have a sister restaurant next
            door, Cara Lazuli, for Moroccan food. Dining there got my photo in the restaurant review section of the Cape
            Argus once. I owe them my fame!!</p>

      <h3>Anatoli - 24 Napier St, Green Point (off Somerset Rd), Tel: 021 419-2501</h3>

      <h3>The Nose Wine Bar, Tel: 021 425-2200,</h3>

      <h3>Clubs:</h3>
      <h3>Rhodes House, 60 Queen Victoria St, Gardens</h3>
      <p>Opens Fri and Sat from 22:00. THE hangout for Cape Town’s young, rich and trendy. Cover charge applies. Often
            has theme parties. Smart-casual but sometimes important to look good to get in faster.</p>

      <h3>Deluxe, 150 Longmarket St, Cape Town</h3>
      <p>Opens Wed, Fri and Sat from 22:00. Casual, hip, 23+</p>

      <h3>Bossa Nova, 43 Somerset Rd, Green Point</h3>

      <p>Opens daily from 21:00. Lounge downstairs and club upstairs. 25+ crowd, for the sophisticated. Dress trendy.
            Cover charge applies.</p>

      <h3>Have breakfast at Rhodes Memorial.</h3>


      <h3>Green Point market (by the stadium)</h3>
      <p>Great market only on Sundays and public holidays (not as good as Sunday). Huge outdoor market, lots of cheap
            junk but also lots of African stuff. Good bargaining skills required. Green Market Square (downtown). Has
            better quality stuff.</p>


      <h2>Robben Island</h2>
      <p>Apparently the people who run the Robben Island trip where you visit the prison where they kept Mandela for
            many years have managed to put themselves out of business due to a bit of reverse racism. The moden boats
            they had to take people over to the island belonged to a white company so they forbade them to do the trip
            and used boats of an african company that were so old and ill maintained that they broke down. So I have no
            idea if you can do the overpriced tour or not. When I went I found it very interesting as your guide is a
            former inmate who shows you around the camp.<A href="http://www.robben-island.org.za">website</A></p>


      <h3>Have dinner at Reubens in Franschhoek</h3>
      <p>Best restaurant in the area and very well priced, not to be missed. Booking imperative. Tel: 021 876-3772.</p>

      <h3>Boschendal in Franschhoek</h3>
      <p>(not for the wine, but for the huge tree you can sit under, taste some so-so wine and chill)</p>
