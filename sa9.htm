		<p>We went to Port Elizabeth for a long weekend from 29.1 to 2.2.2004. We visited the forest of the Tsitsikama
			National Park and the Addo Elephant park. In the Tsitsikama Forest an enterprising South African has
			installed a Treetop Canopy Tour for adventurous tourists. You are strapped into a harness and using a roller
			device you roll down steel cables from one tree to the next. This is the first such contraption in South
			Africa and it was inspired by what some tree researchers set up in Costa Rica. More sites are being set up.
		</p>

		<p>The other outing took us to Addo Elephant park. There we had many excellent sightings of elephants, wild
			boar, warthogs, red hartebeest and ostrich. The park was set up to preserve the Cape Elephant and seems to
			have done a good job of it.</p>

		<p>Port Elizabeth as a city seems to be a bit of a forgotten jewel as far as South African tourism goes. Nobody
			speaks of it. The city, however, is making an effort. The road from the close airport is neatly planted with
			trees and flowerbeds that lack the usual highway rubbish. The place where the hotel was is being developed
			nicely with excellent restaurants in abundance. The beach is clean and a valley between the hotel and the
			casino has been made into a pretty park - probably to prevent shady figures lurking that might molest the
			tourists on their way to and from the casino. All in all it's an attractive city and one I would recommend
			not to miss.</p>
