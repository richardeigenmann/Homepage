		<p>Sandra's business takes her to the Lowveld in the eastern part of the country. She helps farmers there
			prepare for HACCP and EUREPGAP accreditation which they must have if they want to ship their fruit to
			Europe. This weekend she had several visits lined up with the auditor who does the certification.
			Fortunately the farmers had done their homework and they all passed the audit. She took me along and parked
			me next to the pool at the nice guesthouses where we spent the nights. I spent the days enjoying the scenery
			and working at my JPO application on my laptop.</p>

		<p>We spent the weekend in Krueger Park where we were really lucky with animal sightings. We saw Giraffe, Rhino,
			Elephant, Buffalo, Crocodile, Pelican, Kingfisher, Eagle, Vulture, Waterbuck, Blue Wildebeest, Eland, Hippo,
			Lion and even a Cheetah! Unfortunately I botched the photo of the Cheetah as I forgot to look at the
			readings my camera was giving me. The light was fading and I should have changed the ISO setting on the
			camera to get a better shutter speed but was far to excited about the rare animal in front of my lens to
			take note. There's clearly a lot to learn before I can apply for an assignment from National Geographic!</p>

		<p>We were really lucky with the Lion sighting. We drove to the Transport Dam where we immediately sighted a big
			Rhino. There was a heard of Impala at the dam too. After the Rhino wandered on it's way two Impala males
			started to have it out where their rank was. We watched fascinated as the animals crashed their heads
			against each other. We were not quite sure how to determine who the winner was but that was mute as one
			Impala suddenly barked a warning. All the animals in the heard froze and stared intently in one direction.
			Two lionesses marched into sight. The Impalas were very alert but other than barking warnings they didn't
			run off in a fright. Did they realise that the Lions were not going to chase them coming with the wind as
			they were? The lions sniffed at the murky water had a quick rest and then wandered on.</p>
