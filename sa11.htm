		<p>As my temporary residence permit ran out on me I was faced with two choices: Either fill in a pile of forms,
			write a nice story, photcopy everyone's passport, hand an application in to the Department of Home Affairs,
			wait and pay lots of money or pay lots of money to an airline and leave the country. This latter seemed the
			simpler option so I booked a flight with Swiss back home.</p>

		<p>Swiss are troubled with credit card fraud in South Africa. Because of this they don't take bookings without
			physically seeing the credit card. Supposedly their web server tells you this somewhere. I never noticed but
			an overenthusiastic employee in the Johannesburg office discovered that our credit card had not been
			verified and tried to get in touch with us. I'm not sure what number she dialed but in the end she sent me
			an e-mail while I was on the connecting flight to Joburg. When I didn't respond immediately she went ahead
			and cancelled my booking! A friendly station manager managed to sort the mess out but this is not the kind
			of treatment I as a Silver Card holder expect from the airline of my home country!</p>

		<p>When I got in I left for a weekend above Lake Brienz at the Axalp where I could even snowboard.</p>
