<H2>Android Version of Recipe Database</H2>

<P>I've wanted this for a long time and the Google Developers Group Dev Fest in ZÃ¼rich from 19 to 21 October 2012 provided the incentive to get going!</P>

<P>Background: Like many people my parents and I have collected recipes here and there. When the Internet came to consumers in 1995 I put the collection on the web and have tinkered with them ever since. Today there are 500 recipes that I have all cooked, photographed and commented on. (They are mostly in German)</P>

<P>The challenge is that I sometimes find myself in a shop with a special offer or a tasty ingredient and would like to check back on my recipes. Often data cell reception is poor so browsing interactive web pages doesn't work well.</P>

<P>Therefore I wanted an Android App that connects to the recipe store, downloads the key information and allows me to do the searching on the phone. At the GDG Dev Fest I presented my idea and started development.</P>

<P>You can download the App by downloading the <A href="Offline%20Recipe%20Manager.apk">APK File</A></P>

<P>For those interested in the source code, it's on <A href="https://github.com/richardeigenmann/OfflineAndroidRecipeManager">GitHub</A></P>

<P>I'm interested in feedback. You can reach me on: <A HREF="mailto:richard.eigenmann@gmail.com">richard.eigenmann@gmail.com</A></P>
