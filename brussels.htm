	<H2>Restaurants</H2>
	<p>Vietnamese Place next to Petit Suisse square</p>
	<p>Best French Fries: little container next to the Etangs at Place Flagey</p>
	<p>Le Patio D'ete, next to Etangs at Place Flagey: good cuisine with a touch of class moderate prices</p>
	<p>Restaurant La Quincaillerie, rue du Page 45-1050 Ixelles <a
			href="http://www.quincaillerie.be">http://www.quincaillerie.be</a>: Sandra had frog legs there and despite
		reservations found them excellent.</p>
	<p>Marroccan Belly Dance restaurant in the Pavillion half way round the Flagey Etang.</p>
	<p>Ecellent Moroccan Restaurant: La Medina. Between Flagey and Gare de Luxembourg.</p>
	<p>Breakfast: Cafe Belga on Flagey with fresh mint tea, a hummus dish or homemade cake.</p>
	<p>Close to Grande Place (where there are only tourist traps with high prices, snotty service and horrid food) there
		is Asia Grill here locals eat a noodle dish for 6-7 EUR.</p>
	<p>On 22.1.2010 we had dinner in La Case Creole, Lesbroussartstraat 107, 1050 Elsene, Belgium Tel 02 644 63 61. The
		service was OK in this small place but the food was totally tasty. I had a shrimp curry and it was simply
		delicious. Portion size was moderate, however.‎</p>
	<p>On 23.1.2010 we had dinner in Dolce Campagna, Chaussee der Vleurgat 167, 1050 Bruxelles Tel 02/647 88 02. Run by
		multilingual Italians they do excellent Italian food at reasonable prices. I had a japanese inspired tuna tartar
		followed by veal in lemon and white wine sauce. Sandra chose the Saltimbocca alla Rommana.</p>

	<H2>Restaurant in Bruges</H2>
	<p>Restaurant-Brasserie 'Belle Epoque' <A HREF="http://www.belleepoquebrugge.be">www.belleepoquebrugge.be</A> Nice
		Decor, Good service good mussels.</p>
	<p>Check out movie In Bruges: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0780536/</p>
	<H3>To check out</H3>
	<p>Restaurant Amadeo: All you can eat ribs for EUR 14.95</p>
	<p>Check Oki near Place Flagey: Japanese French Fusion 3 Course 30 EUR, 62 Rue Lebroussart. Sandra: "a wired but
		wonderful fusion of Japanese and French cuisine is served"</p>

	<p>If you walk around - don't trust the sign boards in the city centre. They occasionally point in the wrong
		direction. Never ask police for direction - they don't know where they are (Sandra will tell you the story if
		you ask politely)

		<p>Don't miss the palais de justice (at the beginning of Avenue Louise). Go past the scaffolding and see the
			pillars. The state of the building kind of reflects Belgian politics. Seen better days. From there take the
			elevator down into the city centre. Not far away is a flea market on Sundays.</p>

		<p>The Atomium makes for good pictures in the sunlight. Exhibition inside changes.</p>

		<p>Watch out for pick-pockets at the main stations.</p>

		<p>If the light show is still on at the grand place - don't miss it! Usually at 10pm and 10:30pm. Need warm
			cloths.</p>

		<p>Unverified: Don't foget to stop by the Roi d'Espagne (in dialect, "Roy" d'Espagne) for a Jupiler at the Grand
			Place. Also, if you're looking for a great restaurant, check out Comme Chez Soi at Place Rouppe.</p>

		<h2>Pubs</h2>
		<p>Michael Collins on Avenue Luise (never been inside myself)</p>
		<p>There’s a smoky pub with good mussels on Place Flagey.</p>
